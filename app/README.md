# Starter React with Typescript and Enzyme
First commit: 10/05/2021

Last updated: 10/05/2021

## Pre-required
The project is based on:
* [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Typing) - The most efficient language to create static type definitions to Javascript
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/fr/) (Testing)
* [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) (Testing)
* [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) (Css-in-JS)

Instead of using Redux for storing state, I prefer used "Context". If your components reload a lot of state regurlary, delete Context and prefer Redux for a performance optimization. 


## Getting started
Follow this guide to start the project. Enjoy ;).

### Installation
In the project directory:

```Yarn init```


### Running
In the project directory:

```Yarn start```

The project is running in http://localhost:3000. Open your brwoser to view it.


### Building
In the project directory:

```Yarn build```


### Testing
In the project directory:

```Yarn test```

Jest and Enzyme is testing all your predifined Action and create __snapshots__ folders.

If you are in a Watch mode, ```CTRL + C``` to quit.


### Folders
* ./src: The most important folder or your working folder - All your components / pages are in.
* ./src/components: Your components
* ./src/pages: Your pages based on a router
* ./src/core: The core of your Application (Color / typo / Global ...)
* ./src/utils: The utils: Great function like converting CamelCase or kebabCase, getting / setting / deleting cookies and more...
* ./src/

__ENJOY :')__


## Usage
### Create a new Component
In the directory ./src/components.

Create a new folder as component like this ```NameOfYourComponent``` in camelCase.

Add in the folder:
* ```Ã¬ndex.tsx```: your template with state / props and logic
* ```Style.tsx```: your component style
* ```Type.tsx```: your component type
* ```Action.tsx```: your component Action ( not required )
* ```NameOfYourComponent.test.tsx```: Your component test for Jest and Enzyme

You can Copy/paste The Exemple folder ( with a clean structure ) during your development.

Don't forget do delete it before Production.

Don't forget to import your component in the ```./src/components/index.tsx```


### Create a new Pages
In the directory./scr/pages

Create as a component like this ```NameOfYourPage``` in camelCase


### Best practise

Prefer using function myComponent() { ... } instead of const myComponent = () => {...}

Prefer using function myComponent() { ... } for a component with a light livecycle (componentDidMount / componentDidUpdate remplace by useEffect(() => {...}, [...])

Prefer using React Hooks: useEffect and useState instead of livecycle and state.

See [Hooks](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)


### Optimization
If your want to optimize your bundle size or your performance Read try [React.Lazy](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy)
